# The CeF_IRInput library

## Description

Written by Marc Alzina

MIT License, check license.txt for more information.

This library is for receiving and decoding codes from an infra-red remote control using an Arduino.

## Portability

This code was developed and testing using an Arduino Nano (ATmega328) but I believe it should work with no or little modification ( PinMonitor::getInterruptId() ) on other Arduinos.

## Installation

To install, download the zip file, unzip and rename the folder to "CeF_IRInput", copy it in your Arduino libraries directories and restart your Arduino IDE.

## Other

CeF stands for "Comprendre Et Faire".
